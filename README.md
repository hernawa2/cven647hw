# cven647hw

Code for CVEN 647 class (Numerical Analysis in Geomechanics) @Texas A&M University

Project 1 (Finite Difference Analysis of a Laterally and Axially loaded pile)
- Central Difference Scheme, constructing stiffness matrix, and time-update loop

Project 2 (Finite Element Analysis for axially symmetrical cylinder footing axially loaded)
- includes meshing, connectivity matrix construction, differential operator matrix, elemental and global stiffness matrix and solution

Project 3 (Finite Element Analysis for spatial and temporal uncoupled consolidation settlement problem)
- includes meshing, differential operator matrix, global K and Q matrix in uncoupled consolidation analysis, time-updating loop.

Project 5 (Elastic Perfectly Plastic Model with Von-Mises failure criterion and no strain hardening/softening)
- includes initial stress state, stress transformation and main strain controlled loop.
- there is a bug on this version of the code although the output is permissible
